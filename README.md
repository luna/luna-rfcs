## Introduction
Like any Open Source language, Luna welcomes interaction from the community, as 
we believe that only through the community's suggestions and feedback can we 
make Luna the best it can be.

To this end, this repository defines a process to be followed for those people
that want to make 'substantial' changes to the Luna language, `luna` the 
compiler or even this RFC process itself. What we define as a 'substantial' 
change is in flux based on community norms and in relation to the portion of
the ecosystem being changed.

Substantial changes may thus include the following:

- Semantic or syntactic changes to Luna that aren't related to fixing a 
  pre-existing bug.
- Adding or removing language features.
- Changes to the interface between the language and its standard library.
- Additions to the standard library.

The following are examples of changes that do not need to follow the RFC 
process:

- Refactoring of the compiler or libraries that does not change any semantics.
- Additions or alterations that improve numerical metrics (e.g. performance
  improvements, error detection, ergonomics improvements).
- Additions invisible to the users of the language (e.g. new APIs internal to
  the compiler that do not fall under the categories for 'substantial' changes
  listed above).

## Credits
This repository and process takes significant inspiration from the 
[Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) process, and the 
[GHC Proposals](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals) process, so 
thank you to both communities for inspiring us!
